# Hello-World
My name is Joshua, with the code name Codexjo, i am a Physiologist who has a keen interest in technology and how it can be used to solve problems, hence my desire to learn programming. 
For less than a year now, i have learned the basics of Javascripts and PHP. Being a self taught programmer, so far hasn't been easy, but i'm positive that every step on the way, is towards a greater height.
I'm opened to mentoring as well as ideas towards achieving my goal.
My aim is to be a problem solver with my programming skills as well as contributing to better approach and improvement of medicine in the medical sector.
